# Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control Lecture

This repository stores my programming exercises for the Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control lecture (151-0563-01) at ETH Zurich in Fall 2019. In this project, an infinite horizon problem is solved with value iteration, policy iteration and linear programming. Note that the resulting optimal policies may differ but the optimal cost should be the same.

## Requirement

- MATLAB

## Usage

- run `main.m`
